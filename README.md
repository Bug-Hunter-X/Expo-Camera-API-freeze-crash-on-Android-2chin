# Expo Camera Bug on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the Expo Camera API on certain Android devices. The camera preview may freeze or the app may crash, particularly when switching between cameras or using camera features like flash or zoom.  The issue is not consistently reproducible across all Android devices.

## Bug Report

The bug is related to the inconsistent behavior of the Expo Camera API on Android.  The preview freezes or crashes intermittently, making the app unreliable.

## Solution (in bugSolution.js)

This may not solve the root cause of the problem for all devices, but it improves the stability of the app by preventing complete crashes.
